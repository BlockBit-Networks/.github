# Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the **BlockBit `<codebase>`**
<br>
<br>

## About
We are a group of young engineers dedicated to the idea : **Internet of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone**.
<br>
<br>
This github org contains the source code of all the projects undertaken by us. Some of them are open source, some are not (yet).

Our main focus is to push the development of Web 3.0, and on our journey, we look forward to teach, learn, and implement, all that there is, in blockchain development.
<br>
<br>

## Anouncement
We are creating a blockchain based social netowrking forum. It is in development as of now. We will host it on github as a trial.<br>
<br>
If and when the blockchain technology becomes affordable to us (the forum is `region limited` as of now due to `budget constraints`), we will migrate it to WEB3.0<br>
<br>
Be sure to start using it and improving it as soon as it is made available.
