# Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the **BlockBit `<codebase>`**
<br>
<br>

## About
We are a group of young engineers dedicated to the idea : **Internet of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone**.
<br>
<br>
This github org contains the source code of all the projects undertaken by us. Some of them are open source, some are not (yet).

Our main focus is to push the development of Web 3.0, and on our journey, we look forward to teach, learn, and implement, all that there is, in blockchain development.
