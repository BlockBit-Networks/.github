# Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the **BlockBit `<codebase>`**
<br>
<br>

## About
We are a group of young engineers dedicated to the idea : **Internet of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone**.
<br>
<br>
This github org contains the source code of all the projects undertaken by us. Some of them are open source, some are not (yet).

Our main focus is to push the development of Web 3.0, and on our journey, we look forward to teach, learn, and implement, all that there is, in blockchain development.
<br>
<br>

## Anouncement
We are creating a **BLOCKCHAIN** based **SOCIAL NETWORK**.<br>
Ethereum blockchain is being used and the entire backend is supposed to be on smart contracts, using `Solidity`.<br>
<br>
The goal is to develop an open-source social media platform that <br>
* is anonymous
* is completely free of monopolistic moderation, i.e., it will be moderated by the community itself
* rewards original content creators
* provides actual freedom of expression (removes State or MNC controlled censorship)
* is capable of stopping plagiarism
* enables direct interaction (payment) between users thus eliminating dependancy on State
<br>
